# BubbleSort-Visualization
```
Visualizing Bubble Sort algorithm using C++ and SFML
```

## Summary

This is a visualization/simulation of Bubble Sorting algorithm. <br />
Here every line represents a number in the array of Lines, with height being a random number. <br />
Swapping occurs between two adjacent lines depending on the larger number( bigger line in terms of height) <br />
This algorithm has worst case complexity of O(n^2), where n represents the number of elements(or Lines in terms of this project)

## How to Run (only for Linux)

Install [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php) <br />
Install make (command : ```sudo apt install make``` ) <br />
Run command : ```make F1=main.cpp```
